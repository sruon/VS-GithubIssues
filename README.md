VS-GithubIssues
===============

Visual Studio 2013 plugin to display Github issues of a certain repository while working.

Requirements: 
- Octokit

The implementation is extremely naive and should be used with caution. 
For exemple I am pretty sure your password is available to other VSPackages.
I recommend using a test account with just the proper credentials to view issues.

You are free to fork all or part of the code in order to write something better.
